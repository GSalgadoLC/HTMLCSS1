    <h3>
      relational selectors allow us to make cleaner markup but can be fragile if
      sections/paragraphs are moved around. They are not as fast as basic
      selectors. Due to how browsers read and execute selectors. Reads the
      entire time to query paragraph elements but kinda negligible. Perfectly
      fine if fixed location
